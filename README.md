Stitcho'mania (2012) for Windows Phone 8

This has been uploaded for archival purposes only. Stitcho'mania was my first C# Windows Phone application. All the photography is original. Knitting samples, swatches, and paraphernalia are courtesy of <a href="https://github.com/chuhead">Jess</a>.

The SDK and control libraries required to properly build this will likely be hard to find at this point.
